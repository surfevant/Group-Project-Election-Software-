Austin's contribution to d5:
- redid sequence diagrams using GRASP and GoF
- JUnit testing for classes in original ElectsBot

NOTE:
- This version of Electsbot will conflict with Jesse's progress, so only use JUNIT if taking info from this version of the project.
- More JUNIT will need to be done if further classes added
- Class diagrams not altered

TO DAVID:
- if you know how, improve sequence diagrams
- implement HIGH COUPLING LOW COHESION into Electsbot with Jesse by separating methods in controllers and creating object classes.
- add whatever Junit seems necessary
